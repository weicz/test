## Introduction

Nginx\* [engine x] is an HTTP and reverse proxy server, a mail proxy server,
and a generic TCP/UDP proxy server, originally written by Igor Sysoev.
This project provides an extended Nginx working with asynchronous mode OpenSSL\*.
With Intel&reg; QuickAssist Technology(QAT) acceleration, the asynchronous mode Nginx
can provide significant performance improvement.

## Licensing

The Licensing of the files within this project is:

Intel&reg; Quickassist Technology (QAT) Async Mode Nginx - BSD License. Please 
see the `LICENSE` file contained in the top level folder. Further details can 
be found in the file headers of the relevant files.

## Features

* Asynchronous Mode in SSL/TLS processing

## Hardware Requirements

Async Mode Nginx supports Crypto offload to the following acceleration devices:

* Intel&reg; C62X Series Chipset
* [Intel&reg; Communications Chipset 8925 to 8955 Series][1]

## Software Requirements

This release was validated on the following:

* OpenSSL-1.1.0f
* QAT engine v0.5.30

## Additional Information

* Async Mode Nginx SSL engine framework provides new directives:

**Directives**
```bash
Syntax:     ssl_asynch on | off;
Default:    ssl_asynch off;
Context:    http, server

    Enables SSL/TLS asynchronous mode
```
**Example**

file: conf/nginx.conf

```bash
    http {
        ssl_asynch  on;
        server {
            ...
            }
        }
    }
```

```bash
    http {
        server {
            ssl_asynch  on;
            }
        }
    }
```

## Limitations

* Nginx support `reload` operation, when QAT hardware is involved for crypto 
  offloading, user should enure that there are enough number of qat instances.
  For example, the available qat instance number should be 2x than Nginx worker
  process number.

For example, in Nginx configuration file (`nginx.conf`) worker process number
is configured as 

```bash
   worker_processes 16;
```

Then the instance configuration in QAT driver configuration file should be

```bash
    [SHIM]
    NumberCyInstances = 1
    NumberDcInstances = 0
    NumProcesses = 32
    LimitDevAccess = 1
```

## Installation Instructions

### Install Async Mode Nginx

**Set the following environmental variables:**

`NGINX_INSTALL_DIR` is the directory where nginx will be installed to

`OPENSSL_LIB` is the directory where the openssl has been installed to

**Configure nginx for compilation:**

```bash
    ./configure \
        --prefix=$NGINX_INSTALL_DIR \
        --with-http_ssl_module \
        --with-cc-opt="-DNGX_SECURE_MEM -I$OPENSSL_LIB/include -Wno-error=deprecated-declarations" \
        --with-ld-opt="-Wl,-rpath=$OPENSSL_LIB/lib -L$OPENSSL_LIB/lib"
```

**Compile and Install:**

```bash
    make
    make install
```
